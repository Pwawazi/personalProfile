 <p><h2>OUR HISTORY</h2></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;

 <p><h4>Advancing forensic science since 1995</h4></p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
 <p>In 1995, members of the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors (ASCLD) realized the need for an organization with a focus on elevating the quality and consistency of forensic services in our nation’s crime laboratories. Out of that realization was born the National Forensic Science Technology Center (NFSTC), a nonprofit organization with one staff person, $1500 and a charge to ‘do good things’ for the industry. Offices for NFSTC were established at St. Petersburg College, in St. Petersburg, Florida. The early years were focused on laying the groundwork for future programs.</p>

<p>In 1999, NFSTC received congressional earmark funding and, working closely with the Office of Science and Technology, a division of the National Institute of Justice, through a Cooperative Agreement dramatically expanded forensic products and services at no cost to all publicly funded crime laboratories in the U.S. With funding through this agreement, NFSTC relocated its offices in May 2000 to the Young-Rainey STAR Center in Largo, Florida. In May 2014, the offices moved to Bardmoor Palms, around the corner.</p>
<p><h4>Key Project</h4>

<p>Performance Level Auditing offered 9 times on a regional basis to train laboratory staff to become internal auditors. As an extension of the project, NFSTC led the Alabama Department of Forensic Sciences in its preparation to apply for ASCLD/LAB accreditation in under 12 months. This project laid the groundwork for the Quality Documents Program and the “Laboratory Auditing and Accreditation” computer-based workshop (NCJRS Document #193750). (Cooperative Agreement Award #2000-RC-CX-K001)

The fledgling organization was supported by dozens of off-site consultants who focused mainly on performing fee-for-service laboratory auditing projects for the unit referred to as Forensic Quality Services (FQS). In 2003, FQS emerged as a stand-alone, not-for-profit corporation, independent of NFSTC. FQS was acquired by ANSI-ASQ National Accreditation Board in 2012 and continues to serve laboratories nationwide.</p>

<p>NIJ recognized a need for DNA laboratory audits at no charge to public crime labs. In 2002, NFSTC was tasked with developing a program to offer these services nationwide.

In the ensuing years, NFSTC competed for and won a number of NIJ training and program awards both as a stand-alone provider and in partnership with other forensic science associations and organizations. NFSTC is inclusive and partner-driven, working closely with other organizations including ASCLD, the American Board of Criminalists (ABC), Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners (AFTE), and International Association for Identification (IAI).</p>
<p>NFSTC was also instrumental in the creation of the Association of Forensic Quality Assurance Managers (AFQAM).

2002-2003 – ASCLD Conference Support ($500K), mission-oriented partnership to increase participation with laboratory professionals
2003-2006 – AFTE training partnership (Award #2000-RC-CX-K001)
2004 – Development of training for President’s DNA Initiative (Award #2000-RC-CX-K009)</p>
